** Status
The graph updates! I am proud of this success but there is still more work to be done.

** Compiling outside of Vizhub

This interactive horizontal bargraph is based on three Curran Kelleher
excellent videos [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjjYLbShFi8][Scatter plot with menus]], [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RQWC4I2I1s&t=187s][Intro to D3js - Let's make a
face]] and [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlBt-7PuaLk][Making a barchart with d3js]]. I am an Emacs devotee so I try
to stay away from magic online environments like Vizhub where I don't
know what is going on. However, I have to acknowledge that Vizhub does
reduce the cognitive load on creating and compiling programs for the web.

*** What I do

Like Vizhub, I am using rollup.js to create a single javascript file.  Rollup is responsible 
for taking out ES6 module syntax and converting it to ES5 syntax which we can use with
my current version of Node:

~node --version~
~v8.16.1~


To compile I simply type the following at the command line while in the directory of my project.

~rollup index.js --format iife  --file bundle.js~

I then serve the directory an emacs mode called [[https://github.com/skeeto/emacs-web-server][httpd-server]]

** Vizhub

I don't understand why this works in Chrome and Chromium but not
Vizhub.  Any insight is appreciated.
